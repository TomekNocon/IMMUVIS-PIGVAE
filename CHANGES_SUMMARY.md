# Summary of Changes - IMC Reconstruction Quality Fix

## Problem
Model worked well on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST but produced **blurry, averaged reconstructions** on IMC data despite good MSE metrics.

## Root Cause
**Missing normalization** + **VAE posterior collapse** + **inappropriate loss for feature space**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added Feature Normalization
**File:** `src/data/components/graphs_datamodules.py`

**What:** Added channel-wise normalization to `IMCBaseDictTransform`

**Before:**
```python
embedding = embedding.reshape(c, -1).T  # No normalization!
```

**After:**
```python
# Normalize each channel independently
mean = x.mean(dim=(1, 2), keepdim=True)
std = x.std(dim=(1, 2), keepdim=True)
x_norm = (x - mean) / std
embedding = x_norm.reshape(c, -1).T
```

**Impact:** Balances gradients across all 512 feature dimensions

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed VAE Posterior Collapse
**File:** `configs/model/model.yaml`

**Changes:**
```yaml
# Before
kld_loss_scale: 0.0001
kld_free_bits: 0.5

# After
kld_loss_scale: 0.001      # 10x increase
kld_free_bits: 2.0         # 4x increase
```

**Impact:** Forces model to use latent codes instead of ignoring them

---

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Reconstruction Loss
**File:** `src/models/components/losses.py`

**Added:**
- Cosine similarity loss (weight: 0.5) - preserves feature directions
- Improved gradient loss (weight: 1.0) - preserves spatial structure

**Why:** MSE alone encourages averaging in high-dimensional feature space

---

### 4. ✅ Updated Critic
**File:** `src/models/components/model.py`

**Changes:**
- Integrated new loss parameters
- Proper KLD initialization with free bits
- Added cosine loss support

---

## New Files Created

1. **`IMC_RECONSTRUCTION_FIXES.md`** - Detailed technical explanation
2. **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick reference for hyperparameter tuning
3. **`scripts/diagnose_imc_data.py`** - Diagnostic tool to verify normalization
4. **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

---

## How to Use

### 1. Verify Normalization Works
```bash
python scripts/diagnose_imc_data.py
```
Expected: Mean ≈ 0, Std ≈ 1

### 2. Train Model
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### 3. Monitor These Metrics
- `kld_loss` - Should be > 100 (was < 10 before)
- `cosine_loss` - Should be < 0.1
- `gradient_loss` - Tracks structure preservation
- **Visual quality** - Reconstructions should be sharp!

---

## Expected Results

### Before Fix ❌
- Good MSE (0.01)
- Blurry, averaged reconstructions
- Low KLD loss (< 10)
- All samples look similar

### After Fix ✅
- Slightly higher MSE (0.05-0.1) - **This is OK!**
- Sharp, detailed reconstructions
- Higher KLD loss (> 100)
- Diverse outputs for different samples

---

## Key Insights

1. **MSE ≠ Quality in feature space** - Need angular losses like cosine similarity
2. **Normalization is critical** - Feature channels had 1000x scale differences
3. **VAE needs sufficient KLD weight** - Otherwise model ignores latent space
4. **Free bits prevent over-compression** - Allows information in latent codes

---

## If Issues Persist

**Blurry reconstructions still?**
→ Increase `kld_loss_scale` to 0.002-0.005

**Training unstable?**
→ Lower learning rate to 0.00005

**Permutation accuracy low?**
→ Increase `perm_loss_scale` to 1.2-1.5 (model needs retraining)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run diagnostic script
- [ ] Train for 20+ epochs
- [ ] Check KLD loss > 50
- [ ] Visual inspection of reconstructions
- [ ] Compare multiple samples (should be diverse)
- [ ] Check training stability
